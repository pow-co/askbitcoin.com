    "faq1-title":"Welcome to Ask Bitcoin!",
    "faq1-tldr":"AskBitcoin.com is an open source, community-driven application for learning and solving problems as a hive-mind. The site ranks many interesting questions and answers posted by users. The best content gravitates toward the top as users add boost. Posts are stored on the BitCoin blockchain and are indexed using the BoostPOW onchain protocol.",
    "faq2-title":"What is Boost?",
    "faq2-tldr":"(n) a concept for bringing attention to content by attaching proof-of-work. (v) adding proof-of-work to content. Example 1: 'I will consider that idea once it has some boost behind it.' Example 2: 'Great idea! I'm going to boost that!' Boost is also known as 'BoostPOW' (Boost Proof of Work).",
    "faq3-title":"Boosting",
    "faq3-tldr":"By clicking the boost button you open a popup that lets you configure your Boost in terms of difficulty, price and tag.",
    "faq4-title":"Difficulty",
    "faq4-tldr":"What is 'difficulty'? (n) a unit of measurement for proof-of-work. 1 difficulty is equal to the amount of hash power required to mine the genesis block.",
    "faq5-title":"Prices",
    "faq5-tldr":"Prices are set by the user. Users move the slider in the boost modal left or right to select how many satoshis to pay. Left toward the turtle icon means fewer satoshis and slower delivery. Right toward the rabbit icon means more satoshis and faster delivery.",
    "faq6-title":"Tags",
    "faq6-tldr":"Every boost carries with it an opportunity to attach a bit of metadata called a 'tag'. Users add a tag to any boost by typing a word or phrase into the boost modal. Users can then rank content by tag to further narrow their search results.",
    "faq7-title":"Rank",
    "faq7-tldr":"The website AskBitcoin.com ranks Questions and Answers based on how much each one is boosted. When a question or answer gets boosted, it moves up the ranks. This helps focus users' attention on the content with the most proof-of-work attached.",
    "faq8-title":"Time",
    "faq8-tldr":"AskBitcoin.com displays the top Questions and Answers of the last 24 hours by default. Expand the time window of a search using the Tuning Panel on the side of the page.",
    "faq9-title":"Uses",
    "faq9-tldr":"There are three ways to use AskBitcoin.com: 1. Reading the site for interesting information. 2. Posting your own Question or Answers. 3. Boosting Content",
    "faq10-title":"Who gets the satoshis?",
    "faq10-tldr":"Anyone running the boost miner software can earn the satoshis.",
    "faq11-title":"How does it work?",
    "faq11-tldr":"Buying boost places an order for proof-of-work. Satoshis get locked up in a script that says: 'Add X difficulty, get Y satoshis.'",
    "faq12-title":"Then what?",
    "faq12-tldr":"That order gets broadcast to the network via the BoostPOW API. Those running the open-source BoostPOW Miner software will get notified of your order.",
    "faq13-title":"Profitability",
    "faq13-tldr":"Miners determine whether your offer of satoshis for work is worth their effort expending energy. Then they will either get to work adding difficulty to your content, or they will pass. This is why the price paid impacts the speed of delivery. Adding more satoshis per difficulty means higher profitability and therefore greater competition to mine your boost job.",
    "faq14-title":"Distributed",
    "faq14-tldr":"The order sits in waiting and remains valid until it is fulfilled. In this way, a distributed network of miners running open-source software performs the work necessary to perpetuate the BoostPOW system. A miner is free to mine any job no matter the profitability as long as there is at least one satoshi locked in the script.",
    "faq15-title":"Why use this?",
    "faq15-tldr":"The BoostPOW system helps reduce the problems associated with information overload. There is too much information and too little time to evaluate it all. Ranking data by proof-of-work can dramatically reduce the volume of information to be considered down to a more manageable level. And it does this in a way that is open, transparent, and resistant to manipulation."
